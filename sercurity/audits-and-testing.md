# Audits & Testing

The Creative Protocol has undergone three formal professional third party audits. Two have been [conducted by Open Zeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/pooltogether-v3-audit/). And one was [conducted by Ditcraft](https://www.ditcraft.io/blog/pooltogether-v3-smart-contract-audit).

Additionally, the Creative core team and affiliates has a long term security relationship with [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/) including additional code reviews.&#x20;

Notwithstanding, portions of the Creative Protocol codebase will continue to evolve, and **it should never be expected that 100% of the deployed code has been formally audited.**

We encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities in the smart contracts and will pay up to $20,000 in CRTVO for those.  See the [Bounties](bounties.md) for more details.
