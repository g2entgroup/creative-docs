# Frontend Stack

We have decided to work with a framework that not only embraces all the capabilities of ReactJS as our main client-server bridge and is continuously maintained by their contributors but also tools that have been accepted widely by the community. We decided to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) & [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/).
