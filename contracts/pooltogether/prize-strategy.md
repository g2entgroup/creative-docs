# üèÜ Prize Strategy

There will be two rounds of votes üó≥

* What does a creator submission represent in this case (so we know how to encode it on-chain)?

A submission would consist of both: NFT (erc721) and CRTV (erc20)\
&#x20;Creators would deposit (erc20) 10% of the brands deposit amount

* The voting mechanism UI will require this repo [Creative Governance ](https://github.com/g2entgroup/creative-governance)
* [https://github.com/pooltogether/documentation/blob/master/governance/overview.md](https://github.com/pooltogether/documentation/blob/master/governance/overview.md)
* How does vote work (is it in proportion to the tokens an address owns or is it one vote per address regardless of the number of tokens the address owns)? Fans will vote down to the top 10 submissions.

Voting would be basically be users would stake to vote (the percentage we have to discuss) for the top 10. While those users are staking and voting, my thoughts are to allow those fans to earn (social tokens) from the creator they voted for. At the end of the campaign the stakers would receive their (erc20) back.

* What should happen in case of ties (should the voting restart, or should it get extended)?

Ties would start a new vote period for fans to vote and break those specific ties.

* Lastly, brands would select the winner(s) from the top 10.\


Raffle tickets for the final minted NFT üéü will be distributed randomly to fans who voted for the submission winner(s).\


1:1 distribution \


* 1 NFT per submission creator winner,&#x20;
* 1 NFT to brand,&#x20;
* remaining minted NFTs will go to fan winners.
